# linear-algebra

This repository will host code I develop around my learning of linear algebra. I intend to write up major operations in new python code to test my understanding. I will most assuredly end up re-inventing a bunch of already developed python functions, and probably less efficiently, but that's the demo. 

I will mostly be following the book "Introduction to Linear Algebra" 4th ed. by Gilbert Strang
